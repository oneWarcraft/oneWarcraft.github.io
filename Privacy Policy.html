    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [2023.11.20]</p>

    <p>Thank you for using our app! We highly value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, process, and protect your personal information.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

    <p>Our app is a standalone application and does not collect personal information from users in any form. We do not use any tracking technologies and do not store your personal data.</p>

    <h2>1.1 Anonymous Data Collection</h2>

    <p>To improve the app experience, we may use third-party tools (such as Google Analytics) for anonymous data collection. This data is statistical in nature and does not include personal identification information. Please refer to the privacy policy of the respective tool for detailed information.</p>

    <h2>2. Usage</h2>

    <p>Our app is designed to provide standalone functionality and does not need to connect to the internet or servers. Therefore, you can use our app with confidence, without worrying about the collection, storage, or transmission of your personal information.</p>

    <h2>3. Age Restriction</h2>

    <p>Our app is intended for users of all ages, whether adults or children. We respect and protect the privacy of all users. For children under 18, we recommend using our app with the assistance of parents or guardians.</p>

    <h3>Responsibility of Parents and Guardians:</h3>
    <p>We encourage parents and guardians to participate in and supervise their children's activities on the internet. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal information to us, please contact us, and we will take reasonable steps to address the issue.</p>

    <h2>4. Security Measures</h2>

    <p>We take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or destruction. While we strive to protect your personal information, please note that information transmission over the internet is not absolutely secure.</p>

    <h3>Including but not limited to:</h3>

        <li>Use of data encryption technology.</li>
        <li>Access control and authentication.</li>
        <li>Regular security reviews and updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Advertising</h2>

    <p>Our app integrates Google AdMob advertising services provided by Google LLC. Advertising is intended to support our provision of free apps and may involve the collection and use of some personal information to provide more relevant ads.</p>

    <h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>

    <p>Our app offers in-app purchases, one of which is the service to remove ads. Once a user successfully purchases and enables the ad-removal feature, ads will no longer be displayed in the app.</p>

    <h3>Changes in Information Collection:</h3>
    <p>After purchasing and enabling the ad-removal feature, some user information collection related to ads may be reduced since ads will no longer be displayed. However, please note that the app may still collect other information related to app functionality to provide a better user experience.</p>

    <h3>Payment Information:</h3>
    <p>We do not store or process user payment information; this information is handled by the relevant app store (e.g., Apple App Store). Please refer to the privacy policy of the respective app store for more information about payment information.</p>

    <h2>7. Storage of In-App Purchase Information</h2>

    <p>Information related to in-app purchases, such as the purchase of ad removal, is only stored on the user's personal device (phone or other supported devices) and the user's personal iCloud. We do not store or transmit this information anywhere else.</p>

    <h3>User Controls:</h3>
    <p>Users can control the storage and sync settings of their in-app purchase information through device settings. We encourage users to review and adjust their device and cloud storage service settings to meet their privacy preferences for in-app purchase information.</p>

    <h3>Access by Other Users:</h3>
    <p>Except for the user themselves, we will not display or provide the user's in-app purchase information to anyone else. This information is considered the user's personal privacy data, and we will take reasonable technical measures to protect the security of this information.</p>

    <h3>Data Loss:</h3>
    <p>In the event of data loss on the device or cloud storage service, we will not be responsible for recovering or retrieving the user's in-app purchase information. We encourage users to regularly back up their devices and cloud storage services to prevent data loss.</p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Use of encryption technology.</li>
        <li>Access control and authentication.</li>
        <li>Regular security reviews and updates.</li>
    </ul>
